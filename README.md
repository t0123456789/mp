# Making a copy of this game on your own machine

After doing this you can play the game without being online.
You will need access to the your download machine's file system, a way to open zip files and a web browser. 
You can also edit your copy to create and test your own version of this game.

Download the files for this game from github:
	https://github.com/t0123456789/mp

- Open the link, it shows all the files in this game.
- Click the green 'Code' button and select 'Download ZIP' option.
- Save it to your machine, your browser will probably put it in your usual Downloads place with the default file name: mp-master.zip
- Unzip the file, there should be a folder containing all the files you saw earlier.
- Click/Open the file called index.html
- Your default web browser should open a page with the game running, using the files in that folder on your machine.


# Changing the artwork

All the files are in the 'img' folder.
You can edit in whatever edit tool and save the original in any format or size, then export to smaller jpg or png (if alpha channel is needed).
I got test images from Google image search, photos from my mobile and screenshot Snipping Tool in Windows.
I edited image files using Gimp (can be installed from https://www.gimp.org/downloads/)
Do a quick test first just incase...


# Changing menu and quiz data:

The initial questions and answers are in the file called data.js




# Works on many devices, Play with less environmental impact

This game aims to support many old devices and  browser versions, offline play for unreliable internet connections and simple open source code. 

Work is in progress, including this readme file... but the idea is to support using some older legacy devices, saving them from the landfill and saving you the money and carbon footprint of upgrading.


To play your own local version, just download a copy and open the index.html in your browser.

Its also possible to edit your copy to create and share your own modified game version with others,  to make your own quizzes and change the look of pets and items. More details below.


It should work on any current web browsers on desktop, laptop, tablet/mobile/other devices, and is being developed to avoid known issues with older draft and legacy standards and unsupported features.
Many old devices such as PCs are not legacy ones if the web browser software can be updated to a current version. In this case the game should work fine.

It has been checked and works on some legacy mobiles, consoles and tablets including:
(Legacy devices can not be updated, there are no more system updates and may lack it support from the manufacturer, official app stores etc.)
  
 1st generation iPad (the one with no camera), iOS 5 + Safari 5.1
 iPhone 4, iOS 9 + Safari 9
 Moto G phone, Android 7 + Chrome 84 or Firefox 11
 WiiU + default web browser
 PSVita + default web browser


# Security and privacy

If you are playing on a legacy browser, please be aware that security updates are no longer provided for your operating system or software. This means you should not trust it to be secure when you are accessing private information, do not login to your bank account using that device!

This game does not require a login or any personal details or track your data. You can inspect the source code to see exactly what is being accessed on your machine.


# Create your own modified game version

Its easiest to do this on desktop or laptop as you may need to edit the text in source code files or use some sort of image or photo editing software to change the art work.

# Can your choice of games really help the environment?

Obviously you still need to power or charge your device, but most older devices have lower energy consumption than high spec new systems. The cost to the environment from sourcing raw materials to manufacturing and shipping is normally huge compared to the lifetime energy usage of a computer, so it is pretty much always worse overall if replacing an existing device.
When it comes to games compared to other activities, its much lower impact than going on trips or holidays. But it is also good to get out in the real world and look after it if you can!
