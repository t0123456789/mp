# mp game

# A mix of brain training and pet sim.

Stay smart and improve your mental math skills,
practice is even more fun when you earn coins and  buff your pet.

# Works on many devices, Play with less environmental impact

This game aims to support many old devices and  browser versions, offline play for unreliable internet connections and simple open source code. 

Work is in progress... but the idea is to support using some older legacy devices, saving them from the landfill and saving you the money and carbon footprint of upgrading.


To play your own local version, just download a copy and open the index.html in your browser.

Its also possible to edit your copy to create and share your own modified game version with others,  to make your own quizzes and change the look of pets and items. More details below.


It should work on any current web browsers on desktop, laptop, tablet/mobile/other devices, and is being developed to avoid known issues with older draft and legacy standards and unsupported features.

It has been checked and works on some old mobiles and tablets including:
 Android devices with 
 1st generation ipad 
 iphone 4


# Security and privacy

If you are playing on a legacy browser, please be aware that there have been no security updates to your operating system or software. This means you should not trust it to be secure when you are accessing private information, do not login to your bank account using that device!

This game does not require a login or any personal details or track your data. You can inspect the source code to see exactly what is being accessed on your machine.


# Create your own modified game version

Its easiest to do this on desktop or laptop as you may need to edit the text in source code files or use some sort of image or photo editing software to change the art work.

# Can your choice of games really help the environment?

Obviously you still need to power or charge your device, but most older devices have lower energy consumption than high spec new systems. The cost to the environment from sourcing raw materials to manufacturing and shipping is normally huge compared to the lifetime energy usage of a computer, so it is pretty much always worse overall if replacing an existing device.
When it comes to games compared to other activities, its much lower impact than going on trips or holidays. But it is also good to get out in the real world and look after it if you can!
